[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/icanseesharp/react-typeahead-demo/master/LICENSE)



An application to demonstrate the usage of react js with twitter's typeahead and bloodhound frameworks.   

### Application Demo

[Live Demo](https://icanseesharp.github.io/react-typeahead-demo/) of the application is hosted with :heart: by Github
   
   
This application is built entirely using js frameworks, HTML and CSS, it lets you search for the movies and displays the details of the movie when selected from the search results.

I would like to integrate a search for the movie quotes, however I couldn't find API's for quote searches till now, will update the repo if I find one!
  
  

### Following are some (but not all) of the frameworks used to build the application

* [React js](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
* [Twitter Typeahead]( https://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/)
* [Bloodhound Suggestion Engine]( https://github.com/twitter/typeahead.js/blob/master/doc/bloodhound.md)
* [Babel with ES6 preset]( https://babeljs.io/)
* [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp)    





__You can install and try this application on your machine.__

### Installation (For Windows OS)  

* You will need [node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/) to work with npm packages, latest version of npm comes bundled with node.
* Once you have installed node and npm, clone the [repository](https://github.com/icanseesharp/react-typeahead-demo) on your machine.
* Now install all of the above mentioned packages.  
* In case you are new at this (as I was at the time of writing this app,  I've got you covered :blush:)
 1. go to the folder on your machine where you have cloned the repository.  
 2. Shift+Right click -> Open command prompt here.   
 3. run the command to install package e.g. : __npm install --save-dev react__  
 4. __--save-dev__ option installs the package locally for the current project/repository you are working with.   
 5. __npm install -g react__ installs the package globally in your machine.  
 6. Install all the packages in this way.

* Now run the gulp task : __gulp build__
* This will run all the tasks to build the application and start it from port 3000 on your default browser.
